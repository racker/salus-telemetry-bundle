## Cloning the git submodules
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:racker/salus-telemetry-bundle.git
```
### Pulling in submodule changes
Running `git submodule update --recursive` in the top level directory will set each submodule to the commit tagged in this repo.
```
$ git submodule update --recursive
Submodule path 'apps/ambassador': checked out '8fd6d17993001a0d5555f88dc1593ba56ff1ca4c'
Submodule path 'apps/salus-app-base': checked out 'c3b64afad4e2d31c775a7ce40803df1a7dc95630'

$ git submodule status

```

If you wish to update all submodules to the head of their own master branch, you can append `--remote` to that command.
```
$ git submodule update --recursive --remote
...

## Manually creating a new release / version

### Create a PR
This is the easy part of dealing with submodules.  Typically you want to ensure all submodules are on their master branch and up to date, then it is just a matter of creating a new PR as normal.

Checking out the master branch of all submodules can be done via `git submodule foreach --recursive git checkout master`
and then you can update to the latest commit via `git submodule foreach --recursive git pull`.

A `git status` will then show something like:
```
	modified:   apps/ambassador (new commits)
	modified:   apps/api (new commits)
	modified:   apps/auth-service (new commits)
	modified:   apps/envoy (new commits)
```
and you can simply add those to your branch like any other file, add a commit message, and push your branch, followed by creating a PR.

### Create a Release
Once the PR is merged you can then [create a new release via GitHub](https://github.com/racker/salus-telemetry-bundle/releases/new), enter the new tag version, and fill in the other details with relevant information - see the previous releases for examples.

Publish the release and you are done.

## Running/Developing Locally

### Infrastructure

The supporting infrastructure, such as etcd and kafka, can be started by running

```
cd dev/telemetry-infra
docker-compose up -d
```

You can stop the infrastructure by running the following in that same directory:

```
docker-compose down
```

Add `-v` to that invocation to also remove the volumes allocated for the services.

You can watch the logs of any (or all) of the services in the composition using:

```
docker-compose logs -f service ...
```

such as

```
docker-compose logs -f kafka
```

### Consuming from a kafka topic

To verify topic content is flowing and correct, you can exec into the kafka container and
run the standard console consumer, such as

```bash
docker exec -it telemetry-infra_kafka_1 \
  kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9093 --topic telemetry.metrics.json
```

**NOTE** the use of port 9093 instead of 9092

### Querying etcd

The etcd container includes the `etcdctl` command-line tool and is pre-configured to use the v3
API. You can perform operations with `etcdctl` via `docker exec`, such as:

```bash
docker exec -it telemetry-infra_etcd_1 etcdctl get --prefix /
```

### Connecting to MySQL

MySQL can be started within a docker container by running
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-mysql.yml up -d
```

It will create a database named `default` with username `dev` and password `pass`.

Once running, in addition to connecting services to it, you can connect to the instance and query the database manually:

```
$ docker ps
docker CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
fd12115575bd        mysql:5.7                         "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   12 days ago         Up 12 days          0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   telemetry-infra_mysql_1

$ docker exec -it telemetry-infra_mysql_1 sh

# mysql -u dev -ppass

mysql> use default;

mysql> show tables;
+--------------------+
| Tables_in_default  |
+--------------------+
| hibernate_sequence |
| labels             |
| resource_labels    |
| resources          |
+--------------------+

mysql> select * from resources;
```

### Pre-loading monitor translations, etc

Some integration points in the system, especially telegraf's usage of rendered monitor content, assume certain database content is present. In the deployed clusters, the data-loader is integrated with Github webhooks; however, for local development, a fresh database volume needs to be pre-loaded manually using the data-loader. That can be done at any time using the following:

```
cd tools/data-loader
go run ./... --debug --admin-url http://localhost:8888 \
  load-from-git https://github.com/Rackspace-Segment-Support/salus-data-loader-content.git
```

### Applications

> The following procedure is IntelliJ specific but the process will be similar for other IDEs.

To open the project in IntelliJ, use the "open" option from the intro window, (or the File->Open dropdown).  Do not use either "Create New Project" or "Import Project" options, as those will misconfigure the project.  Open the root directory of this project, (the same one this readme is located in.)

In the "Maven Projects" tab (usually on right side of IDE window), click the "Generate Sources and Update Folders"
button to generate the protobuf/grpc code that is located in the `libs/protocol` module. That button is shown here:

![](img/maven-generate-sources.png)

IntelliJ, as of at least 2019.3, will auto-create run configurations for each of our Spring Boot applications under the `app` directory; however, you will need to add `dev` to the active Spring profiles as shown here:

![](img/active-profiles-dev.png)

The run configuration for `apps/auth-service` also needs the following "Override Parameters" set to the values returned by the [setup-app-role.sh script](#setting-up-vault-for-development-usage):
```
  vault.app-role.role-id
  vault.app-role.secret-id
```

The run configuration for `apps/ambassador` also needs the "Working directory" set to the `dev` directory of this bundle module. That will ensure it can read the development-time certificates from the `certs` directory contained there.

For example:
![](img/auth-service-props.png)

Go based modules, such as `apps/envoy`, may not be auto-detected as modules initially. If that's the case, then open the Project Structure configuration and perform an "Import Module" operation as shown here:

![](img/import-module.png)

With that, when opening any of the *.go files within those modules, you should be prompted to setup the GOROOT, such as:

![](img/prompt-setup-goroot.png)

If not, you can manually enable Go support for modules in the project preferences as shown here:

![](img/configure-goroot.png)

Finally, IntelliJ should auto-enable support for Go modules; however, if it doesn't you can set (or check) that setting also in the project preferences, as shown here:

![](img/enable-go-modules.png)

Launch each of the run configurations by choosing it from the drop down in the top-right of the IDE window
and clicking the "Run" or "Debug" button to launch in the respective mode. It is recommended you use debug mode in
most cases since you can add breakpoints on the fly:

![](img/debug-mode.png)

### Maven usage for applications

The [app base README](apps/salus-app-base/README.md) contains information about how to build
and run the application modules with Maven.

### Setting up Vault for development usage

The Vault server itself is already included in the Docker "infra" composition.

With that container already running, run the following to setup app-role authentication 
to be used by the Salus applications:

```bash
docker exec -it telemetry-infra_vault_1 setup-app-role
```

### Running the Docker application images

**NOTE** When running with Docker for Desktop, you might need to increase the VM
settings to 4 vCPUs and 8 GiB of memory. Those settings are located in the "Advanced" tab.

The following environment variables will need to be set when running Docker Compose. 
You can set those without the `export` in a file named `dev/telemetry-apps/.env`, 
set them in IntelliJ's run config, if running Compose there, or set them via your shell.
The `.env` approach is best since it works with all the ways of running Compose.

- `IMG_PREFIX`
- `VAULT_APP_ROLE_ROLE_ID`
- `VAULT_APP_ROLE_SECRET_ID`

For Google Cloud Builder built images, the `IMG_PREFIX` would be something like the following,
where `PROJECT_ID` is replaced with GCP project ID.

    gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/

**NOTE** the trailing slash is *required*. Use `gcloud auth configure-docker`,
[described here](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling), to 
configure authentication for pulling those images.

The "VAULT" values are provided during the Vault setup in the previous section.

With those set, execute the following in the `dev/telemetry-apps` directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The Envoy config file `dev/envoy-config-authserv.yml` can be used with this set of
containers.

You can always ensure the latest images are being used by running

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

The `dev/telemetry-apps` also contains a `check-health.sh` script, which you can run
to query the actuator health endpoints of the apps. The built-in [healthcheck](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#healthcheck)
couldn't be used since it assumes the use of `curl`, but that is purposely not installed
in the app containers.

#### Including Repose to replicate deployment-time authentication

Before starting the Repose services you will need to declare the Keystone/Identity credentials of 
a service/user account that is authorized to validate authentication tokens:

```bash
export KEYSTONE_USER=...
export KEYSTONE_PASSWORD=...
```

With that, you can run the following in the `dev/telemetry-apps` directory to start the Repose
services each for public and admin authentication:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-repose.yml up -d 
```

### Running Event Engine with simulated metrics

The Event Engine applications (`event-engine-ingest` and `event-engine-management`) can be run locally
along with the entire end-to-end of Salus applications, Ambassador, Envoy, etc; however, for
development and testing of just the Event Engine piece it is easier just to simulate the
metrics that would normally  be routed to Kafka/UMB by the Ambassador.

To start with, ensure you have the infrastructure components runnings by bringing up the
Docker composition `dev/telemetry-infra/docker-compose.yml`. That composition includes two
instances of Kapacitor.

With the infrastructure running, start the `event-engine-ingest` and `event-engine-management`
applications both with the Spring `dev` profile activated. That profile will ensure the 
applications are configured to interact with the two Kapacitor instances in the infrastructure
composition.

Finally, to simulate some metrics, run the application located in `dev/metrics-gen`. For IntelliJ
to recognize that module, you'll need to right click its `pom.xml` and choose "Add as Maven project".
With it added to the overall project build, you'll be able to run it as a typical Spring Boot application.

That application will randomly pick a set of resources with a set of labels each. Within each resource it will
randomly come up with a sine wave definition of measurements for each. The logs at startup
will display the resources and measurements that were randomly defined. The variability and
number of those can be configured in the `application.yml` of that application. A `small` profile
is provided as an example of a variation of the application configuration.

As a result, you will be
able to pick any one of the resource+measurement combinations and configure event scenarios,
such as rising/falling threshold, based on the periodicity of the chosen measurement.

## Publishing Docker images to GCR

Use [the preparation part of these docs](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling) 
to install the Cloud SDK tools and configure Docker for authentication. You can disregard the 
details about `docker push` since the [Maven jib plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin)
will take of the equivalent operations.

**Tip:** on MacOS you can install the Cloud SDK using brew:

```bash
brew cask install google-cloud-sdk
```

In each of the application modules, run the following replacing `$PROJECT_ID` with the Google
Cloud project's ID, which is of the form of an identifer and number separated by a dash:

```
mvn -P docker -Ddocker.image.prefix=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID deploy
```

If publishing a snapshot version of the Maven projects, then add

```
-Dmaven.deploy.skip=true
```

to skip the Bintray publishing of the Maven artifacts.

If the local system doesn't have Docker installed, you can still perform the remote publish and
skip the local Docker build by adding:

```
-DskipLocalDockerBuild=true
```

## Publishing Java artifacts to Bintray

For non-SNAPSHOT builds of the Java applications, a `mvn deploy` can publish the built artifacts
to Bintray; however, you will need to declare your Bintray access credentials in
`$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` as shown in the following, but replacing `BINTRAY_USERNAME` and
`BINTRAY_APIKEY` accordingly.

```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>bintray-racker-maven</id>
      <username>BINTRAY_USERNAME</username>
      <password>BINTRAY_APIKEY</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```
